# AI Python for Beginners #3 & #4

Complete the tutorials at https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-python-for-beginners/ . (I just used my Google ID to sign up for an account.) Use this repository to turn in your completed notebooks for assignment credit. Some of the lessons are just videos, but some lessons have attached notebooks you should complete as you watch the videos. You learned many of the concepts from the W3 tutorials, but this is a nice opportunity to see them in a new context. The presenter also does a nice job demonstrating how you can use AI tools to understand code and write new code. Turn in a completed notebook for each of the videos listed below to receive full credit.

## AI Python for Beginners: Basics of AI Python Coding

You should have completed these modules in a previous assignment. https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerPyth_AIPythonBeginners

## AI Python for Beginners: Automating Tasks with Python

You should have completed these modules in a previous assignment. https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerPyth_AIPythonBeginners

You can complete the notebooks directly in the tutorial interface. You can download a completed notebook by going to File - Download as - Notebook (.ipynb) before moving onto the next. You can then upload your notebook file to your GitHub repository.

DeepLearning.AI sends out a regular newsletter where Andres Ng talks about emerging trends in AI and notifications when new tutorials are released. I've found a number of the tutorials informative. You might consider signing up for the newsletter to keep abreast of new developments in the field. https://www.deeplearning.ai/
